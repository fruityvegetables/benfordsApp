# Benford's Ingestion [![BADGE](https://img.shields.io/badge/License%3A-MIT-blue)](https://img.shields.io/badge/License%3A-MIT-blue)
## Description
This is a challenge from a bioinformatics lab. The requirements are: Build a Python based web-app using Tornado or Flask, that can ingest a flat file of data and assert Benford's law. It should handle dirty data, and display back to the user a graph of both the ingested data and an overlay of the expected distribution of numbers. It should also inform the user if there is a match between the two. It must contain a docker file to function correctly, with bonus points for automated tests and a stretch challenge of setting up a database. The database would allow anybody (not a user authentication system) to browse through the datasets uploaded, and see the results.
